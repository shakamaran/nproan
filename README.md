historical notes:

Tested RAM requirements:
Minimum is 2GB RAM per physical core.
A chunk size of 100MB should reliably work. Must be lowered if RAM runs low.
This chunk size is for the raw_data which is stored in uint16

dont know what this was about:

#median = da.median(dark_p, axis=(0,2))
#offset_corr = dark_f - median[np.newaxis,:,np.newaxis,:]
#offset_corr.astype(np.float32).to_zarr('/home/snorre/work/apantias_dev/offset_corr.zarr', overwrite=True)
#offset_masked = da.where(bad_pixels[np.newaxis,:,np.newaxis,:], np.nan,offset_corr)
#offset_masked.to_zarr('/home/snorre/work/apantias_dev/offset_masked.zarr', overwrite=True)
#np.nanmedian needs a lot of memory!
#common_modes = da.nanmedian(offset_masked, axis=3)
#common_modes.to_zarr('/home/snorre/work/apantias_dev/common_modes.zarr', overwrite=True)
#signals = offset_masked - common_modes[:,:,:,np.newaxis]
#signals = da.mean(signals, axis = 2)
#signals.to_zarr('/home/snorre/work/apantias_dev/signals.zarr', overwrite=True)

07.09.26:
DONE:
renamed config.py to settings.py
finished the settings structure
added module doc for how the settings should be used

TODO:
move functions from utils to a compute module
edit the compute functions to use the new config
test a fresh run (without reusing, just recalculate everything think about adding that later on)
think about nrepseval for the fresh run
add a parameter on whether to keep the rawdata after the run
think about a folder where the raw zarr data can be saved and reused.
configure dasks memory spilling
maybe use half the processes but 2 threads per if memory problems arise
DOCUMENT everything that was done

15.09.26:
DONE:
setup on laptop finished
tested on clip from laptop

TODO:
setup a simple standard analysis
configure a place where zarr data lives in case bin to zarr has been called already.
move functions from utils to a compute module
edit the compute functions to use the new config
test a fresh run (without reusing, just recalculate everything think about adding that later on)
think about nrepseval for the fresh run
